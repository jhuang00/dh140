# Digital Humanities 140


## Course Description

Coding is a skill. Coding is an art. Coding is a tool for creating other forms of expression, web sites, video games, music, and graphic visualizations of the flow of information and ideas. Coding has produced products that unify people, separate people, reinforce love, reinforce prejudice, entertain, bore, destroy, propagandize, and calm. Coding has had an undeniable impact on the modern world. This course will introduce you to coding through the language of Python.

On the one hand, the course will develop your fluency in Python and general coding skills. We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python to the computer, we will learn about Python in the context of other languages, we will learn how to use libraries of Python code, and we will learn how to use Python to tell stories of our own. On the other hand, the course will expose you to ways that Python can be used in the humanities. During our hands-on experiences gaining Python fluency, weâ€™ll look at examples that include (but are not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks.


## Coding & Data Science Project

I want to use Python and relevant tools to do a project through data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. I don't have a specific dataset or topic in mind that I want to explore, and I am open to exploring a wide range of options.
